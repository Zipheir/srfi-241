# SRFI 241 Pattern Matcher

This is my fork of the Marc Nieper-Wi√ükirchen's implementation of the
[SRFI 241](https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-241) pattern-matching macro.
I've tried to rewrite the implementation in a simpler and more readable
style, and have made some semantic changes as well.

## Changes from SRFI 241

* The `_` pattern variable is treated as a wildcard. It matches
  anything but is never bound to a value. It can appear any number
  of times in a pattern.
